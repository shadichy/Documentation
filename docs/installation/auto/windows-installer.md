## Using BlissOS installer shipped within BlissOS ISOs

By default BlissOS ISOs come with an installer `.exe` that can help you quickly install BlissOS without any bootable device (USB,...)

## Using [Xtr126's Android-x86 Installer][Android-x86 Installer]

Cross-platform Android x86 installer desktop app built with Tauri.

The installer can function without root access. For safety, it was designed not to mess with the bootloader.
It re-uses the grub config and kernel command line parameters from the ISO.
